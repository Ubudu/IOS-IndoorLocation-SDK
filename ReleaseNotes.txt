Change history
--------------
Version 2.7.0
	- Add attractor mode of operation

Version 2.6.1
	- Fix issues related to location accuracy and latency
	- Add zones to  position log
	- In some cases, it is possible to be switched from GPS localization to BLE location while being truly outdoor but nearby the venue.

Version 2.6.0
	- Custom logger + default "real time logger"
	- Simplified API
	- Fix issues related to starting ILi

Version 2.5.1 
	- Significatly better position stability by improving sensor fusion logic

Version 2.5.0
	- Better position stability by improving RSSI measurements
	- Additional logic for protection against false outdoor -> indoor switches (If you experience such cases, ask Ubudu for additional support) 

Version 2.4.1
	- Improved GPS / BLE and BLE / GPS switching
	- managing zones by ID - not name
	
Version 2.4.0
	- Position logs
	- Improved GPS logic for better performance
	- Improved GPS - BLE switching
	- Improved map switching

Version 2.3.0
	- Improved logic for GPS updates with freshness algorithm
	- Improved GPS - BLE switching
	- Reduced lag in updating a position while not walking
	- Reduced CPU usage
	- Speedup position computation 

Version 2.2.0
	- API to get info if user is moving or not
	- Further GPS improvements and stability

Version 2.1.4
	- Particle filtering with GPS
	- All stored maps are preloaded into memory to make floor switching faster. Very usefull for very big maps
	- Improved PDR by updating the logic for calculating a position update
	- Simplified processing of ranged beacons. Position is calculated up to 6 times faster than before
	- Reduced lag with BLE - GPS switching
	- Improved the stability of the position
	- Fixed checking for horizontal GPS accuracy

Version 2.1.3
	- Improved motion processing
	- Fix positioning while using custom accuracy treshold.

Version 2.1.2
	- Fix an issue with BLE / GPS switching

Version 2.1.1
	- SDK is built with bitcode enabled.
	- Fix a possible blocking main thread when sdk starts for the very first time.	

Version 2.1.0
	- GPS integration. Ubudu IL SDK provides a position based on bluetooh and sensor fusion, pure inertial positioning or GPS.
	- Option to switch floors manually instead of recognizing floors (maps) automatically by the SDK.
	- Improved motion data processing.
	- Reduced lag in positioning. Especially if user is moving fast.
	- Fix preloading ubudu map data.
	- Fix a possible lag / error in accuracy while switching from inertial positioning to ble with sensor fusion.

Version 2.0.0
	- Advanced sensor fusion to improve the positioning and to allow to update positions even if BT signal is very weak.
	- Add path finding to ommit non-navigable areas and to improve the stability of positioning.
	- Transition zones to improve stability of switching maps in strategic areas.
	- Support for applications with secure mode enabled.
	- Tiles support for il maps.
	- Show compass calibration if needed.
	- improved positioning accuracy by introducing an advanced motion sensors processing based on particle filtering
	- Accuracy of Positioning improvements by an advanced motion sensor processing based on particle filtering and pedestrian dead reckoning.
	- Reduce lag in positioning (especially after bringing app from bg)



Version 1.0.0
	- Automatic floor switching
	- Remote content auto-update
	- API to allow download png overlays of the maps
	- Stability Improvements
	- Positioning improvements

Version 0.9.0
	- Indoor Location Georeference functionality
	- Support POI from map
	- Motion filtering to improve accuracy ond stability of location
	- Added polygons for zones
	- Image url for map to allow using overlays (on Google maps, Apple maps etc.)
	- Color property for UBUZone
	- CurrentZones property for PositionUpdate
	- Stability improvements

Version 0.1.1
	- Documented the SDK.

Version 0.1
	- First beta release of the SDK.
